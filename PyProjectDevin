import csv


# Step 1: Read the file into python and print the number of lines
with open("data11Oct21.csv", "r") as file:
    lines = file.readlines()
print(f"The file has {len(lines)} lines ")

# Step 2: Write a function that prints out all the column headers in alphabetical order
header_line = lines[2].strip()
headers = header_line.split(",")
abc_header = sorted(headers)
print(abc_header)

# Step 3: Write another two functions that take a column header as an argument. One min and one max of the column
column_name = "Exhaust Press(Torr)"
index = header_line.index(column_name)
#print(index) #used this to find which column number im pulling from
